Storytime is a framework to parse and render Interface Builder Storyboard files.
Support for more components and output formats soon.

## Motivation
If you've ever developed for iOS/macOS you've probably tried to QuickLook into a storyboard file only to be disappointed.
I've created Storytime as a way to visually display storyboards outside of Interface Builder, This could be QuickLook, Git Client, etc.

## Internals
Storyboards a actually very simple XML files so parsing them is pretty stright forward.
Initially I tried using XSLT to transform the Storyboard into HTML but ran into some issues.

This version parses the storyboard into classes conforming to a protocol `STTElement` which defines the `-htmlRepesentation` method.
Using the Ratchet CSS framework and the html produced by the various elements you get a pretty (although not 100%) accurate visual representation of the storyboard.

## Known Issues
There are a lot of them!

1. Views (`-htmlRepresentation`) are coupled with the models (`STTElement`) which is due to me being in a hurry to get this working
2. Various rendering issues
3. CSS coupled with HTML template
4. etc.

Feel free to create issues when you find them.

## Questions

### Why Objective-C?
It's what I like using, also, it's required if you want to create a QuickLook generator.

### Why is the code like this?
Well, this started out as a quick hack and I got excited when things first started showing up so I wanted to release it as fast as possible :)
